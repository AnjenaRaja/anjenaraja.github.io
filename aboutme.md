I am currently a senior at **Burbank High School**, with plans to apply as a first-year student in 2025. Alongside my high school education, I’ve also taken college courses at **Los Angeles Valley College** and **Los Angeles Mission College** to deepen my academic experience.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been recognized for my accomplishments and dedication. I received a **Letter of Commendation** from the **National Merit Scholarship Program** for my performance on the PSAT. I am proud to be a **National Cyber Scholarship Foundation Scholar with Honors**, having received the **CyberStart Silver & Bronze Awards**. In mathematics, I earned **3rd place in the U.S.** and **2nd place in California** in the **Math Kangaroo Competition**, which included over 6 million participants worldwide. I am also an **AP Scholar with Distinction** and a **California Scholarship Federation Gold Seal Bearer**, where I serve as a volunteer tutor and club leader.

At **Burbank High School**, I take on leadership roles as the **Chairwoman of the Coding Club** and the **President and Founder of the Digital Electronics Club**. In addition to my academic and leadership activities, I am an active member of the **Burbank High School Chamber Orchestra**, where we received a **Gold Rank** at the **San Diego Heritage Music Festival**, and I’ve had the honor of performing alongside professional musicians.

Outside of school, I am deeply involved in cybersecurity and technology. I serve as an **Advisory Board Member for the Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC)** and have completed an internship as a **Future Ready Engineer at RTX (Raytheon)**. During this internship, I worked with industry professionals on solutions for space communications and developed a working model as part of my research. Additionally, I’m a **Technician Class HAM Radio Operator** with the call sign **KO6FIE**, and I’ve interned at the **Housing and Grants Department for the City of Burbank's Community Development**.

In my free time, I enjoy volunteering at the **Burbank Public Libraries** as a **Teen Library Volunteer** and participating in other community service activities.
