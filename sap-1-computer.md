# SAP (Simple-As-Possible) Computer

## Architecture

## Clock 
### Overview
The Nexys A7 FPGA development board operates with a clock running at 100 MHz, which is too fast for us to meaningfully observe the state transitions in a simple SAP-1 architecture. Our goal is to slow the clock down to about 1 Hz so that we can visually track the state transitions. Furthermore, to assist in debugging and execution analysis, we need the ability to step through states manually.

To accomplish this, we use the following key features on the development board:

1. 16 slide switches – One of these switches is dedicated to toggling between automatic slow clock mode and manual step mode.
2. Push button – This button is used to manually advance the clock when in single-step mode.
3. LED – We use an LED to indicate the clock pulse, allowing for visual confirmation of the clock's operation.
Since mechanical switches and buttons tend to produce noisy signals due to bouncing (brief unintended transitions), we implement debouncing to ensure reliable and stable clock control.

### Key Requirements
1. Slow the system clock: The 100 MHz clock is slowed down to 1 Hz using a clock divider, so that each state transition occurs every second.
2. Manually advance the clock: In manual mode, we use a push button to advance the clock.
3. Switch between automatic and manual clock modes: A slide switch toggles between the two modes.
4. Halt the clock: A halt signal is used to stop the clock when the program completes.
5. Reset the clock and debounce logic: The reset signal restores the clock to its default state and clears any pending signals.
6. Visual clock pulse: An LED is driven by the clock signal to provide a visual cue of clock activity.

### Inputs and Outputs
#### Inputs:

* clk_in: 100 MHz input clock from the Nexys A7 FPGA board.
* reset: A reset signal to reset the clock and debounce logic.
* mode_switch: A slide switch to select between automatic (slow clock) and manual (step-by-step) modes.
* step_button: A push button to manually step through the clock in manual mode.
* halt: A flag to stop the clock when the program execution is complete.

#### Output:

* clk_out: The output clock signal, either slowed down or advanced manually.

### Internal Signals and Registers

* DIVISOR: A parameter set to 50,000,000, which divides the 100 MHz clock to approximately 1 Hz.
debounced_step_button and debounced_mode_switch: Debounced signals from the button and slide switch, ensuring clean transitions.
* counter: A 32-bit counter used for clock division to achieve the slower clock frequency.
* slow_clk: A slow clock signal that toggles at 1 Hz.
* button_state_prev: Used to store the previous state of the step button for edge detection.

### Debouncing the Button and Switch
Mechanical switches and buttons often produce multiple, unintended transitions due to bouncing. Without debouncing, the FPGA could interpret a single press as multiple presses, causing unreliable behavior. To prevent this, we use a debounce module to filter out the noise.

The debounce module uses a parameter DEBOUNCE_TIME to define the time required to stabilize the signal, ensuring only one clean transition is registered when a button is pressed or a switch is toggled.

### Clock Divider for Slow Clock Mode
The input clock (clk_in) runs at 100 MHz, which is too fast for observing state transitions. To slow this down, we use a clock divider that counts clock cycles and toggles the clock output (slow_clk) when the count reaches DIVISOR - 1. This produces a clock signal that runs at 1 Hz, meaning each clock pulse occurs every second.

### Clock Output Logic
The clock output logic determines whether the system is in single-step mode or slow clock mode:

* Single-Step Mode: When the mode_switch is high, the system waits for a button press to advance the clock. The clock only toggles on the rising edge of the step_button.
* Slow Clock Mode: When the mode_switch is low, the clock toggles automatically based on the slower clock (slow_clk) generated by the clock divider.

### Reset and Halt Functionality
The reset signal is used to restore the clock to its initial state and clear any pending signals. The halt flag allows us to stop the clock when the system needs to halt, such as when the computer completes its program.

### Visual Clock Pulse
To provide a visual indication of the clock pulse, we can connect an LED to the clk_out signal. This allows us to visually observe each clock pulse, making it easier to follow the clock transitions in real time.

### Verilog Code for Clock

```verilog

                counter <= 0;
                slow_clk <= ~slow_clk;  // Toggle the slow clock
            end else begin
                counter <= counter + 1;
            end
        end
    end

        end else begin

                if (debounced_step_button && ~button_state_prev) begin
                    clk_out <= (halt) ? 0 : ~clk_out;
                end
            end else begin
                // Slow clock mode: use the divided slow clock

            end
            button_state_prev <= debounced_step_button; // Store the previous button state
        end
    end

### Verilog Code for Debouncing Switches

```verilog
module debounce (
    input wire clk,           // System clock (e.g., 100 MHz)
    input wire reset,         // Reset signal
    input wire noisy_signal,  // Noisy input signal (button press)
    output reg debounced_signal // Debounced output signal
);

    parameter DEBOUNCE_TIME = 100000; // Debounce time in clock cycles

    reg [31:0] debounce_counter = 0; // Counter to track signal stability
    reg stable_signal = 0;           // Stable signal before debouncing

    // Debounce Logic
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            debounce_counter <= 0;
            debounced_signal <= 0;
            stable_signal <= 0;
        end else begin
            if (noisy_signal == stable_signal) begin
                debounce_counter <= 0; // No change in signal, reset counter
            end else begin
                // Signal has changed, start counting
                if (debounce_counter >= DEBOUNCE_TIME) begin
                    stable_signal <= noisy_signal; // Signal stable for long enough
                    debounced_signal <= noisy_signal;
                    debounce_counter <= 0;
                end else begin
                    debounce_counter <= debounce_counter + 1; // Increment counter
                end
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
```

## Program Counter
### Overview
The Program Counter (PC) is a critical component in any CPU, including the SAP-1 architecture. Its role is to keep track of the address of the next instruction to be executed. In this case, the PC is a 4-bit counter, which means it can store values from 0 to 15 (in binary, 4 bits). Each time the clock signal (clk) ticks, the PC can either increment by 1 or reset to 0 if needed.

### Inputs and Outputs
#### Inputs:
* clk: The clock signal, which controls when the PC updates.
* reset: A signal to reset the PC to 0.
* inc: An increment signal. When inc is high, the PC increments by 1.
#### Output:
* pc_out: The 4-bit output value of the Program Counter. It holds the current address of the next instruction.
### Functionality
#### Reset and Increment
* Reset (reset): When the reset signal is active (1), the PC is reset to 0. This ensures that the Program Counter starts from the first instruction of the program, typically during initialization or when a system reset is triggered.
* Increment (inc): The inc signal is used to increment the PC. When inc is active (1), the PC increases by 1 on each rising edge of the clock (clk), but only if the current PC value is less than 15 (4'b1111). This prevents the counter from overflowing since it is only 4 bits wide. Once it reaches 15, it will stop incrementing.

### Key Points
* Clock Signal (clk): The Program Counter updates on every rising edge of the clock signal. This is typical in digital circuits to ensure that updates occur synchronously with the clock.
* Reset Mechanism: The pc_out is set to 0 whenever the reset signal is active. This ensures that the counter starts from the beginning of the program execution or when a reset is required.
* Conditional Increment: The Program Counter only increments if the inc signal is high and the current value of pc_out is less than 15 (4'b1111). This guarantees that the PC does not overflow past its 4-bit limit, ensuring it stays within the range 0-15.

### Application in SAP-1
In the SAP-1 architecture, the Program Counter is essential for stepping through instructions stored in memory. Each instruction is fetched from memory using the current value of the Program Counter (pc_out), which is then incremented to point to the next instruction. The ability to reset and control the PC makes it easier to manage program flow during execution, particularly when debugging or running test programs.

### Verilog Code for Program Counter

```verilog
module pc (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input wire inc,
    output reg [3:0] pc_out
);
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            pc_out <= 4'b0;
        else if (inc && pc_out < 4'b1111)
            pc_out <= pc_out + 1;
    end
endmodule
```

## Memory (RAM)
### Overview
The memory module simulates the RAM (Random Access Memory) in the SAP-1 architecture. In this design, the memory holds the program instructions and data that the CPU will execute. It has 16 addresses, each storing 8 bits of data, which is typical for small, simple processors like the SAP-1. This module is essential for storing both the program instructions and the data that the CPU will process.

### Inputs and Outputs
#### Inputs:
* address: A 4-bit address input that specifies which memory location to access. Since it's a 4-bit address, there are 16 possible memory locations (2^4 = 16).

#### Outputs:
* data_out: An 8-bit output that provides the data stored at the given address. This data could represent either an instruction (for the CPU to execute) or data to be used in a computation.

### Functionality

#### Memory Array
The memory is defined as a 16-byte array (ram), where each location holds 8 bits of data. This memory holds both the program instructions and data used by the processor. The memory is initialized with both instructions and data values at specific addresses.

* Instructions: These are the first few locations in memory (addresses 0 to 4). They form a small example program that the CPU can execute:
  * ram[0] = 8'b00011110; — Load the value from memory location 14 (LDA 14).
  * ram[1] = 8'b00101111; — Add the value from memory location 15 (ADD 15).
  * ram[2] = 8'b00111101; — Subtract the value from memory location 13 (SUB 13).
  * ram[3] = 8'b01000000; — Output the result to the output register (OUT).
  * ram[4] = 8'b11110000; — Halt the CPU (HLT).
* NOP (No Operation): The program includes several NOPs (No Operation), which are instructions that do nothing. These are placeholders in memory locations 5 to 12.
* Data: Memory locations 13, 14, and 15 store the data used by the program:
  * ram[13] = 8'b00000010; — Stores the value 2.
  * ram[14] = 8'b00000110; — Stores the value 6.
  * ram[15] = 8'b00000101; — Stores the value 5.

#### Output Logic
Memory Access: Whenever the CPU provides an address via the address input, the module outputs the corresponding data via data_out. The data_out register is updated with the data stored at the given address in the memory array.

### Key Points
* Memory Initialization: The initial block pre-loads the memory with both instructions and data before the simulation or operation starts. This is useful for testing and running small programs within the SAP-1 CPU.
* Program Structure: The program consists of a series of instructions (like LDA, ADD, SUB, OUT, and HLT) that the CPU will execute in sequence. These instructions manipulate the data stored in other memory locations.
* Simple Addressing: The memory uses a 4-bit address (address), which allows the CPU to access any of the 16 memory locations. Each memory location holds an 8-bit value (data_out).

### Application in SAP-1
In the SAP-1 architecture, this memory module is used to store both the program instructions and the data the CPU needs to process. The Program Counter (PC) provides the memory address to this module, which in turn outputs the corresponding instruction or data. This is an essential part of how the CPU fetches and executes instructions from memory.

### Verilog Code for Memory

```verilog
module memory (
    input wire [3:0] address,
    output reg [7:0] data_out
);
    reg [7:0] ram [0:15]; // 16 bytes of memory

    initial begin
        // Example program
        ram[0]  = 8'b00011110; // LDA 14
        ram[1]  = 8'b00101111; // ADD 15
        ram[2]  = 8'b00111101; // SUB 13
        ram[3]  = 8'b01000000; // OUT
        ram[4]  = 8'b11110000; // HLT

        ram[5]  = 8'b00000000; // NOP
        ram[6]  = 8'b00000000; // NOP
        ram[7]  = 8'b00000000; // NOP
        ram[8]  = 8'b00000000; // NOP
        ram[9]  = 8'b00000000; // NOP
        ram[10]  = 8'b00000000; // NOP
        ram[11]  = 8'b00000000; // NOP
        ram[12]  = 8'b00000000; // NOP

        ram[13] = 8'b00000010; // Data at memory location value 2
        ram[14] = 8'b00000110; // Data at memory location value 6
        ram[15] = 8'b00000101; // Data at memory location value 5
    end

    always @(*) begin
        data_out = ram[address];
    end
endmodule
```

## Registers

## Accumulator - A Register
### Overview
The A register is an essential part of the SAP-1 architecture. It serves as an accumulator, a common register used in many simple CPUs. The accumulator holds data that will be manipulated by arithmetic and logic operations, and stores the result of these operations. In this design, the A register can load data from an external source (e.g., memory or another register) and is updated on each clock cycle when required.

### Inputs and Outputs
* Inputs:
  * clk: The clock signal that drives the register's operation.
  * reset: A signal to reset the register's output to zero.
  * load: A control signal that, when high, allows the register to load new data.
  * data_in: The 8-bit data input to be loaded into the register.
* Outputs:
  * data_out: The 8-bit data output, which holds the current value of the register.

### Functionality
The A register performs two main functions:
1. Storing Data: It holds an 8-bit value, which can be loaded from the data_in input when the load signal is high.
2. Resetting the Data: When the reset signal is activated (high), the register clears its output, setting data_out to 0.
* Reset Behavior
  * If the reset signal is high during a clock cycle, the register output (data_out) is immediately reset to 0.
* Load Data Behavior
  * If the reset signal is not active, and the load signal is high, the register loads the data from data_in into data_out on the rising edge of the clock signal.

### Key Points
1. Reset Functionality:
   * When the reset signal is high, the register output data_out is cleared to 0 on the rising edge of the clock.
   * This ensures that the register can be cleared and ready for new operations.
2. Data Load Control:
   * The load signal controls when new data is loaded into the register.
   * When load is high during a clock cycle, the value from data_in is transferred to data_out.
3. Clock-Synchronized Operation:
   * The register is edge-triggered, meaning that it updates its value only on the rising edge of the clock (clk).
   * This ensures that the operations are synchronized with the rest of the system.

### Application in SAP-1
In the SAP-1 architecture, the A register serves as the accumulator. It stores data used in arithmetic operations like addition or subtraction. It holds the operand fetched from memory or the result of computations, making it a vital component in the processor's operation.
For example:
* When executing an LDA instruction, the value from memory is loaded into the A register via data_in.
* When performing an ADD instruction, the A register holds one operand, while the other comes from memory or another register. The result of the addition is stored back in the A register.

The reset signal allows the register to be cleared, and the load signal controls when new data is loaded into the A register.

### Verilog code for A Register

```verilog
module a (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input wire load,
    input wire [7:0] data_in,
    output reg [7:0] data_out
);
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            data_out <= 8'b0;
        else if (load)
            data_out <= data_in;
    end
endmodule
```

## B Register

### Overview
The B register in the SAP-1 architecture is another general-purpose register, much like the A register, but with a specific role during arithmetic operations. The B register typically holds the second operand in arithmetic operations such as addition or subtraction. In this simple CPU design, it temporarily stores data to be used in conjunction with the value in the A register.

### Inputs and Outputs
* Inputs:
   * clk: The clock signal that drives the register's operations.
   * reset: A signal to reset the register's output to zero.
   * load: A control signal that, when high, allows the register to load new data.
   * data_in: The 8-bit data input to be loaded into the register.

* Outputs:
   * data_out: The 8-bit data output, which holds the current value of the register.

### Functionality
The B register performs two main functions:
1. Storing Data: It holds an 8-bit value, which can be loaded from the data_in input when the load signal is high.
2. Resetting the Data: When the reset signal is activated (high), the register clears its output, setting data_out to 0.

* Reset Behavior
  * If the reset signal is high during a clock cycle, the register output (data_out) is immediately reset to 0.
* Load Data Behavior
  * If the reset signal is not active, and the load signal is high, the register loads the data from data_in into data_out on the rising edge of the clock signal.

### Key Points
1. Reset Functionality:
  * When the reset signal is high, the register output data_out is cleared to 0 on the rising edge of the clock.
  * This ensures that the register can be cleared and ready for new operations.
2. Data Load Control:
  * The load signal controls when new data is loaded into the register.
  * When load is high during a clock cycle, the value from data_in is transferred to data_out.
3. Clock-Synchronized Operation:
  * The register is edge-triggered, meaning that it updates its value only on the rising edge of the clock (clk).
  * This ensures that the operations are synchronized with the rest of the system.

### Application in SAP-1
In the SAP-1 architecture, the B register works in tandem with the A register during arithmetic operations. While the A register holds the primary operand (or the result of operations), the B register stores the secondary operand, typically fetched from memory.

For example:
* During an ADD operation, the value in the A register is added to the value in the B register, and the result is stored back in the A register.
* During a SUB operation, the B register holds the value to be subtracted from the A register.

This register is essential for performing two-operand arithmetic, and its functionality is critical for basic ALU operations in the SAP-1 CPU.

### Verilog code for B Register

```verilog
module b (
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input wire load,
    input wire [7:0] data_in,
    output reg [7:0] data_out
);
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset)
            data_out <= 8'b0;
        else if (load)
            data_out <= data_in;
    end
endmodule
```

## Memory Address Register (MAR)

### Overview
The Memory Address Register (MAR) in the SAP-1 architecture holds the address of the memory location that is currently being accessed. It is a critical component in the fetch-decode-execute cycle, responsible for pointing to the next instruction or data in memory. The MAR ensures that the correct address is supplied to the memory during read or write operations.

### Inputs and Outputs

* Inputs:
  * clk: The clock signal that drives the register’s operations.
  * reset: A signal to reset the register's output to zero.
  * load: A control signal that, when high, allows the register to load a new memory address.
  * address_in: The 4-bit address input to be loaded into the register.
* Outputs:
  * address_out: The 4-bit address output, representing the current memory address stored in the MAR.

### Functionality
The Memory Address Register (MAR) is a simple register that holds a 4-bit address used to point to a memory location. The MAR loads the new address from the address_in input when the load signal is high and can be reset to zero using the reset signal. This register plays a vital role in accessing instructions or data stored in memory.

#### Reset Behavior
* If the reset signal is high during a clock cycle, the MAR output (address_out) is immediately set to 0. This clears the memory address, ensuring that the system starts fresh during reset.

#### Load Address Behavior
* If the reset signal is not active and the load signal is high, the MAR loads the value from address_in into address_out on the rising edge of the clock. This address is then used to access a memory location in the next step of the instruction cycle.

### Key Points
1. Reset Functionality:
  * When the reset signal is high, the register output address_out is cleared to 0 on the rising edge of the clock. This is useful when restarting the program or resetting the system.
2. Address Load Control:
  * The load signal controls when the new memory address from address_in is loaded into address_out.
  * When load is high during a clock cycle, the address from address_in is transferred to address_out, and this address is used to access the appropriate memory location.
3. Clock-Synchronized Operation:
  * The register is edge-triggered, meaning that it updates its value only on the rising edge of the clock (clk).
  * This ensures that the operations are synchronized with the rest of the system, ensuring proper timing in the CPU's fetch-decode-execute cycle.

### Application in SAP-1
In the SAP-1 architecture, the Memory Address Register (MAR) is used to hold the address of the memory location being accessed for fetching instructions or data. During the fetch stage of the instruction cycle, the MAR is loaded with the next instruction address. The address stored in the MAR is used to retrieve the instruction from memory, which is then executed by the CPU.

For example:
* During the fetch phase, the program counter (PC) provides the address of the next instruction. This address is loaded into the MAR.
* The memory module uses the address from the MAR to retrieve the instruction from memory.

The MAR is essential for addressing memory locations and plays a key role in ensuring that instructions are fetched and executed in the correct order.

### Verilog code for Memory Address Register (MAR)

```verilog
module mar(
    input wire clk,
    input wire reset,
    input wire load,
    input wire [3:0] address_in,
    output reg [3:0] address_out
);
    always @(posedge clk, posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            address_out <= 4'b0;
        end else if (load) begin
            address_out <= address_in;
        end
    end 

endmodule
```

## Instruction Register (IR)

### Overview
The Instruction Register (IR) in the SAP-1 architecture holds the current instruction that the CPU is executing. It splits the instruction into two parts: the opcode (the operation to perform) and the operand (the data or address associated with the operation). The IR plays a critical role in controlling the CPU's execution flow by interpreting and storing instructions fetched from memory.

### Inputs and Outputs
* Inputs:
  * clk: The clock signal that synchronizes the register's operations.
  * reset: A signal to reset the instruction register to zero.
  * load: A control signal that, when high, loads a new instruction into the IR.
  * instruction_in: The 8-bit input representing the instruction to be loaded.
* Outputs:
  * opcode: The 4-bit output representing the operation part of the instruction.
  * operand: The 4-bit output representing the data or address part of the instruction.

### Functionality
The Instruction Register (IR) takes an 8-bit instruction input (instruction_in) and splits it into two 4-bit parts:

* The opcode (higher 4 bits) specifies the operation the CPU should perform.
* The operand (lower 4 bits) provides the data or memory address for the operation.

#### Reset Behavior
* If the reset signal is high during a clock cycle, both opcode and operand are reset to 0, ensuring that no previous instruction remains in the register when the system is restarted.

#### Load Instruction Behavior
* If the load signal is high during the clock cycle, the IR loads the 8-bit instruction_in into its opcode and operand fields. The 4 most significant bits are stored in opcode, while the 4 least significant bits are stored in operand.

### Key Points
1. Reset Functionality:
  * When the reset signal is high, both the opcode and operand are cleared to 0. This ensures that no previous instruction remains in the IR after a reset event, such as restarting the CPU or clearing the current state.
2. Instruction Loading:
  * When the load signal is high, the 8-bit instruction_in is split into the opcode (higher 4 bits) and operand (lower 4 bits) on the rising edge of the clock.
  * The opcode determines what operation will be executed (e.g., ADD, SUB, LDA, etc.), while the operand provides the associated data or memory address for that operation.
3. Clock-Synchronized Operation:
  * The IR updates its values only on the rising edge of the clock (clk). This ensures that the register operates in sync with the rest of the system, allowing the fetch-decode-execute cycle to proceed smoothly.

### Application in SAP-1
In the SAP-1 architecture, the Instruction Register (IR) is loaded with the instruction fetched from memory during the fetch phase. Once loaded, the instruction is split into:
* The opcode: This tells the control unit which operation to perform (e.g., ADD, SUB, HLT).
* The operand: This provides the memory address or data value needed for the operation.

For example, in a simple program:
The instruction 8'b00101111 (binary) could be decoded as:
* Opcode: 0010 (binary) → ADD operation
* Operand: 1111 (binary) → Memory address or data value for the ADD operation

During the fetch-decode-execute cycle:
* The IR first holds the instruction fetched from memory.
* The control unit then decodes the opcode and operand, determining the next operation to perform.

This register is vital for orchestrating the correct execution of instructions, ensuring that the CPU operates according to the program stored in memory.

## Display
The development board has 8 seven-segment LEDs, which we would like to use to display the hexadecimal values of various signals such as the Program Counter, the Bus, the Memory Address Register (MAR), the RAM contents pointed to by the MAR, T States, and more.

We need to decode the hexadecimal values to drive the individual segments of the seven-segment LED displays. Additionally, a multiplexer is required to control each of the seven-segment displays. Since we are relying on persistence of vision, we will use the system clock to refresh the display.
